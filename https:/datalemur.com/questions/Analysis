----- For this project I use datalemur.com to solve some SQl practice questions.

-----Question #1 - Assume you are given the tables below about Facebook pages and page likes. 
------Write a query to return the page IDs of all the Facebook pages that don't have any likes. The output should be in ascending order.
SELECT pages.page_id 
FROM pages
LEFT JOIN page_likes
ON pages.page_id = page_likes.page_id
WHERE liked_date IS NULL
ORDER BY pages.page_id;

-----Question #2 - Given a table of candidates and their skills, you're tasked with finding the candidates best suited for an open Data Science job. 
You want to find candidates who are proficient in Python, Tableau, and PostgreSQL.
Write a query to list the candidates who possess all of the required skills for the job. Sort the the output by candidate ID in ascending order.
SELECT candidate_id 
FROM candidates 
WHERE skill IN('Python' ,'Tableau' ,'PostgreSQL')
GROUP BY candidate_id 
HAVING COUNT (skill) = 3
Order BY candidate_id;

----Tesla is investigating bottlenecks in their production, and they need your help to extract the relevant data.
