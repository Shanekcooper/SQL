# In this project I seek to answer some questions from the chinook data set, 
which represents a digital media store and includes tables for artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.


-----#1Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US.
SELECT FirstName, LastName, CustomerId, Country FROM customers
WHERE Country != "USA"

------#2Show only the Customers from Brazil.
SELECT * FROM customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil"

------#3Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. 
SELECT C.FirstName, C.LastName, I.InvoiceId, I.InvoiceDate,I.BillingCountry FROM invoices I
LEFT JOIN customers C
ON I.CustomerId = C.CustomerId
WHERE C.Country = "Brazil"

-----#4Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.
SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE Title = "Sales Support Agent"

------#5Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.
SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry FROM invoices

------#6Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent.
SELECT E.FirstName, E.LastName, I.invoiceId
FROM employees E
JOIN customers C
ON E.employeeId = C.SupportRepId
JOIN invoices I
ON C.CustomerId = I.CustomerId


-------#7Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers.
SELECT E.FirstName AS EMP_Fname, E. LastName AS EMP_Lname, C. FirstName AS CUS_Fname, C.LastName AS CUS_Lname, C.Country,INV.Total FROM employees E
JOIN customers C ON E.employeeId = C.SupportRepid
JOIN invoices INV ON C.customerId = INV.customerId

-----#8How many Invoices were there in 2009?
SELECT COUNT(InvoiceId) FROM invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate LIKE'2009%'

----#9What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(UnitPrice*Quantity),2) FROM invoice_items Inv_items
LEFT JOIN invoices 
ON  INV_items.Invoiceid = invoices.Invoiceid
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'

-----OR
SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

-----#10 Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line item.
SELECT InvoiceLineId,Name FROM invoice_items
LEFT JOIN tracks
ON invoice_items.trackId = tracks.trackId

------#11 Write a query that includes the purchased track name AND artist name with each invoice line item.
SELECT I.InvoiceLineId, t.Name,t.Composer FROM invoice_items I
 JOIN tracks t
ON I.trackId = t.trackId

-----#12 Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.
SELECT t.Name AS track_Name, A.Title As album_title,g.Name As genrename, m.Name AS media_type
FROM albums A 
JOIN tracks t
ON A. Albumid = t.Albumid
JOIN genres g
ON t.Genreid = g.Genreid
JOIN media_types m
ON t.MediaTypeid = m.MediaTypeid

-------#13 Show the total sales made by each sales agent.
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.lastName, ROUND(SUM(Total),2) AS total_sales
FROM employees 
JOIN Customers cus
ON employees.employeeId = cus.SupportRepid
JOIN invoices INV
ON cus.CustomerId = INV.customerId
GROUP BY employees.FirstName

--------#14Which sales agent made the most in sales in 2009?
SELECT employees.FirstName, employees.lastName, ROUND(SUM(Total),2) AS total_sales
FROM employees 
JOIN Customers cus
ON employees.employeeId = cus.SupportRepid
JOIN invoices INV
ON cus.CustomerId = INV.customerId
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31'
